# TicTacToe
Implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game for one player against the computer - Part of an exercise proposed in my Unity course (Array matrix and simple mouse interaction example).

## Instructions:
- It's you versus the computer.
- Mouse click to place your symbol in an empty cell on the grid.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all cells are filled, and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw (a "cat's game").
